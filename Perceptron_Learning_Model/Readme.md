# Perceptron Learning Algorithm:

A perceptron isn't the Sigmoid neuron we use in ANNs or any deep learning networkS.

The perceptron model is a more general computational model than McCulloch-Pitts neuron. It takes an input, aggregates it (weighted sum) and returns 1 only if the aggregated sum is more than some threshold else returns 0. Rewriting the threshold as shown above and making it a constant input with a variable weight, we would end up with something like the following:
