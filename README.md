# Deep_Learning

Deep learning is an AI function that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, translating languages, and making decisions. Deep learning AI is able to learn without human supervision, drawing from data that is both unstructured and unlabeled

# The most popular deep learning algorithms are:
1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
4. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
5. Stacked Auto-Encoders.
6. Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)
7. Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
